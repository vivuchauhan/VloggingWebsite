          Moila Top or also known as Moila Bugyal is a Himalayan Alpine Meadow near Chakrata which is roughly 40km from
          this location. This meadow has scenic views throughout with panoramic views of the Himalayas at the top. To
          reach this location one has to cross the mystical Deodar Forest. There are few caves at the corner of the
          Bugyal
          that are believed to be built by Pandavas, there is also a Shiva temple at the top.

          Head out on this 10.5-km out-and-back trail near Shillai, Uttarakhand. Generally considered a moderately
          challenging route, it takes an average of 3 h 45 min to complete. This is a popular trail for birding, hiking,
          and snowshoeing, but you can still enjoy some solitude during quieter times of day.
