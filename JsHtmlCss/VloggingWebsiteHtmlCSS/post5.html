          This area was also centre of Lakulisha Shaivism, a revivalist sect worshipping Lord Shiva. Saint Lakulisha,
          name literally meaning, club-bearing Lord, was a wandering ascetic who is considered to have united different
          sects and revived worship of Lord Pashupati. This faith later flourished under Bharashiva and Vakataka
          dynasties of southern and central India. Piligrims who came after Saint Lakulisha considered Lakulisha as the
          last of twenty-eight incarnations of Lord Shiva, as mentioned in the Puranas.
