          Haridwar is located in the northern state of Uttarakhand, India. Being a religious as well as a spiritual
          country allows people following different faiths to thrive harmoniously in India. Haridwar is a Hindu
          pilgrimage site visited by Hindus around the year. The river Ganges, which is considered holy and sacred in
          the Indian context, enters the Indo-Gangetic plains for the first time via Haridwar in India. Every year,
          several foreigners visit the place to understand the meaning of faith, pure bliss, and nirvana. In addition to
          this, they also become so enchanted with the vibes of faith, that they even decide to explore the yoga capital
          of the world Rishikesh, which is located just one hour away.

        <h4 class="post3-lead">The holy water of Ganges</h4>
        <p class="post3-lead">
          The common legend in Hindu households is that if you bathe in the holy waters of the Ganges, then you rid
          yourself, along with your ancestors, of all the worldly sins, which eventually leads to salvation. The Ganges
          water is considered as an elixir, the liquid that descends directly from the heavens for humans. In most Hindu
          houses, you can find 'Ganga Jal' or 'Ganga Water' in their prayer rooms or revered spots. On auspicious
          occasions in Hindu households, holy 'Ganga water' is sprinkled to ward off negative spirits. That's how pious
          and holy Ganga water is considered to be in India. The tradition is that anytime anyone visits the holy land
          Haridwar, they bring with themselves the holy water (available for purchase in plastic bottles) for their
          families and relatives.

          If you are visiting Haridwar for a holy dip for the first time, please remember that Ganges water remains icy
          cold throughout the year. So choose accordingly - during afternoons, the temperature drops a bit. Also, every
          evening, there are aartis or prayers offered to the river Ganga - as in India the river is considered to be
          sacred, which sustains the life of people in this land. The soothing evenings are special as flowers and
          prayers are offered to the river along with fire lamps in prayer plates. It is a one-of-a-kind experience as
          the air is filled with revitalizing chants, flames from prayer plates, and a lot of devotees offering
          heartfelt prayers. Moreover, there are several yummy food options around such as Halwa, Aloo puri, jalebi, and
          popular peda to entice your taste buds. You can also try them all out.

          There are several temples around such as Mansa Devi Temple, Chandi Devi Temple, Maya Devi Temple, Daksha Maha
          Dev Temple, etc, which can be explored to seek divine blessings. Visiting Haridwar is about exploring the holy
          realms of life outside and within. One can even find several sadhus here, who have renounced the worldly life
          in search of salvation. Watching them is quite a sight with their several feet long hair, mud-smeared body,
          and loincloth. Once every 12 years, Haridwar hosts the mega Kumbh Festival, which sees a lot of devotees
          coming together from around the globe to witness the religious and spiritual spectacle.
