        <h4 class="post4-lead">How Can You Reach Tungnath Temple?</h4><br />
        <p class="post4-lead">
          The Tungnath Mahadev Temple is located in the state of Uttarakhand, India. Travelers have to move towards the
          Rudraprayag district to visit this temple. Your first destination should be Chopta Valley, where you will find
          the beginning of the trekking route to this temple.
        </p><br />
        <p class="post4-lead">
          The temple is located at an elevation of 3470 meters above sea level, and the trekking route will be
          challenging. It would be best if you climbed high altitude, and the route passes through the Kedarnath
          Wildlife Sanctuary. Therefore, you will not find human habitats along the route. Travelers should hire
          professional guides for the trek to Tungnath temple in Uttarakhand.
        </p><br />
        <p class="post4-lead">
          The best way of reaching Chopta by road is by taking a bus service from Delhi, the capital city of India. You
          will find multiple private bus operators on this route, and an online ticket booking facility is available
          through third-party booking applications. The nearest railway station to Chopta is Rishikesh Railway Station,
          though the rail station is not operational yet. Instead of Rishikesh, tourists can reach Rudraprayag railway
          station to reach Chopta Valley. Dehradun Airport is the nearest airport to the Chopta Valley.

        <h4 class="post4-lead">The Best Time to Visit Tungnath</h4>
        <p class="post4-lead">
          The time between April and October is the best time to visit Tungnath. However, trekkers and adventure lovers
          can visit the place anytime. However, you must avoid the monsoon as the overall road condition becomes risky
          during this season. The time between June and August or mid-September is not appropriate for tourists due to
          the monsoon.
        </p><br />
        <p class="post4-lead">
          So, these are the things that you should know about the Tungnath trek before planning your journey. It would
          help if you had a professional guide for the trekking route and contacted a local tour operator who can help
          in such cases.
