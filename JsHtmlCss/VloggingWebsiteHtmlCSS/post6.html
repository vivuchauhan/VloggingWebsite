          Mahasu name came from Lord Shiva (a combination of 4 forms of Shiva). People all around the nation come here
          to travel and take the blessings of the Mahasu Devta. The temple has two orbicular rocks about 1 ft. in
          diameter. The mythology is to lift these rocks on your shoulder and head and then throw them to the ground.
        </p><br />
        <p class="post6-lead">
          Some old people have their beliefs that only a pure-hearted person can only lift up these rocks (also called
          Marbles of Bheem). The Mahasu Temple is considered one of the most sacred temples in north India.

          A 5-day long festival which has been named as Shaant Festival, was 1st held in 2004 in which a high number
          of animals were being killed in form of worship. But the Priests of the community, later on, agreed to
          prohibit the ritual killing of animals in the future so now the traditional fair is held in the month of
          August every year for 3 days and nights.
